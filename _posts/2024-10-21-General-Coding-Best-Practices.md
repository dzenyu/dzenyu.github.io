## Coding Best Practices

Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code is a critical skill for every engineer. Below are best practices that can help you and your team build reliable systems.

### 1. Code Readability
- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable, method, and class names.
- Follow established naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes).
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

### 2. Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully with proper logging and actionable error messages.
- Avoid swallowing exceptions; always log or rethrow them.
- Use custom exceptions when applicable to clarify the intent.

### 3. Testing
- Write unit tests for small, isolated pieces of logic.
- Add integration and end-to-end tests for critical workflows.
- Strive for a good test coverage percentage, but focus on meaningful test cases over numbers.

### 4. Performance
- Measure performance before optimizing; premature optimization can introduce complexity.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms suitable for the problem domain.
- Profile applications to identify actual bottlenecks.

### 5. Security
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs.
- Use libraries and frameworks that follow secure coding practices.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets—use secret managers or environment variables instead.

### 6. Version Control
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Use feature branches to isolate work in progress.
- Follow Git workflows (Git Flow, trunk-based development, etc.) that fit your team.

### 7. Collaboration
- Actively participate in code reviews and accept feedback constructively.
- Share knowledge with the team through pair programming or design discussions.
- Keep communication open to align technical decisions with business goals.

### 8. Documentation
- Maintain a project-level **README** with setup and usage instructions.
- Add inline documentation for complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
- Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for documenting APIs.

### 9. CI/CD
- Automate builds, tests, and deployments to reduce manual effort.
- Ensure that automated pipelines run quickly to provide fast feedback.
- Integrate quality checks (linting, tests, security scans) into pipelines.

### 10. Maintainability
- Refactor often to reduce technical debt.
- Follow the **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** principle to avoid duplication.
- Write modular, reusable code for better maintainability and scalability.

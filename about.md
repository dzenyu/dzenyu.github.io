Hi, I’m **Dzenyu Samuel Mukangara** — a Principal Software Engineer who thrives on turning complex requirements into **simple, resilient, and maintainable systems**. Over the years, I’ve built a career at the intersection of **architecture, hands-on coding, and engineering leadership**, helping teams ship reliable software at scale.

> **Principal Software Engineer | Java & Spring | Kafka & Event-Driven Systems | AWS Cloud | Platform & Team Builder**  
> Helping teams deliver **resilient, high-throughput microservices** with clarity, reliability, and scale.  

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 A Little About Me
Outside of technology, I’m first and foremost a **husband and proud dad of two amazing kids**. Family is at the heart of everything I do — whether it’s cheering my kids on in their adventures, enjoying movie nights, or exploring the world together.  

Travel has been one of our favorite ways to connect as a family. We’ve made memories in **Australia, Jamaica, South Africa, Qatar, Dubai, the UK, Zambia, Zimbabwe**, and more — always returning to our home base in **DFW, Texas**.  

When it’s time to recharge, I turn to music. My playlists are a mix of **Afrobeat, Country, Gospel, Reggae, RnB, Soul, Sungura** — sounds that keep me energized, inspired, and grounded.

## 💻 What I Do
- **Architecture & Delivery** → data-intensive services (batch + streaming)  
- **Backend Development** → Java/Spring microservices with pragmatic DevOps on AWS  
- **Event-Driven Design** → Kafka (streams, schema management, state stores)  
- **API Design** → RESTful APIs and Federated GraphQL schemas
- **Payments & Billing Systems** → integrate payment gateways and SaaS billing platforms (Braintree, Stripe, Recurly, BillDesk/UPI)
- **Subscription Lifecycle Design** → reliable subscription management and billing flows
- **Webhook Ingestion** → robust event handling and reconciliation
- **System Hardening** → observability, reliability, and cost-aware scaling  
- **Leadership & Mentorship** → growing high-performing engineering teams  

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Advanced **stream processing** with Kafka Streams & RocksDB performance tuning  
- **Event-sourcing** and **transactional outbox** patterns for consistency  
- **Cloud cost guardrails** → right-sizing, autoscaling, and efficient data layout  
- **Developer experience** → golden paths, starter templates, and code quality tooling  

## 🚀 Highlights
- **Database Tooling** → Delivered cross-platform admin utilities adopted by DBAs worldwide (Embarcadero/Idera).  
- **Media Metadata Distribution** → Built large-scale playlist and EPG pipelines (TiVo Corp.).  
- **Hybrid AWS Migrations** → Designed fault-tolerant services across on-prem and AWS (S3, EC2, DynamoDB, ElastiCache).  
- **Payments & Subscriptions** → Integrated with Braintree, Stripe, Recurly, BillDesk (UPI), and in-app purchase workflows.  
- **Batch & Data Pipelines** → Built resilient workflows with Spring Batch, AWS Batch, and AWS DMS.  
- **Commerce Migrations** → led the migration of Chegg’s commerce stack to a SaaS billing vendor (Recurly); reduced ops overhead and improved reconciliation processes — see the [case study](/case-study/2025/03/01/Chegg-Commerce-SAAS-Vendor-Selection).

## ✍️ Speaking & Writing
I share **practical insights** on architecture, Java/Spring practices, and platform engineering.  
Topics often include:

## 🛠 Tech Stack (abridged)
- **Core Java & Algorithms** → concurrency, memory management, and efficient data IO  
- **Distributed Systems** → 7+ years designing & operating high-scale distributed systems  
- **Performance Optimization** → eliminating bottlenecks, optimizing data flow  
- **Cloud & DevOps** → AWS (ECS, Lambda, MSK, S3, RDS, Batch, SQS, SNS), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform  
- **Observability & Ops** → Splunk, NewRelic, Cortex; CI/CD best practices  
- **Architectural Expertise** → Microservices, Event-Driven Systems, API Design, Platform Engineering  
- **Other Interests** → Graph DBs (Neo4j, Dgraph), AI tools (Cursor AI, Gemini, ChatGPT)  

## 🧭 How I Work
- **Bias for clarity** → simple designs, small PRs, production-first mindset  
- **Pragmatic quality** → meaningful tests, guardrails over gatekeeping  
- **Operational empathy** → logs/metrics/traces by default; SLOs guide design  
- **Collaborative leadership** → unblock fast, mentor often, document always  

## 🤝 Mentorship
I enjoy **coaching engineers** on system design, testing, and platform fundamentals.  
If you’re looking to level up your team, bootstrap a new service, or improve platform reliability, I’m glad to help.

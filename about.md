Hi, I’m **Dzenyu Samuel Mukangara** — a Principal Software Engineer who enjoys turning complex requirements into simple, maintainable systems. I work across architecture, hands-on coding, and engineering leadership to help teams ship reliable software at scale.

## A Little About Me

Beyond the world of tech, I’m a husband and proud dad of two amazing kids. Family is at the heart of everything I do — whether it’s cheering on my kids’ adventures, enjoying movie nights, or exploring the world together.

Travel is one of our favorite ways to connect as a family. We’ve created lasting memories in the **Australia, Jamaica, South Africa, UK, Zambia, Zimbabwe** and more, with our home base in **DFW, Texas**.

When I’m not building systems or spending time with my family, you’ll often find me listening to music. My playlists are usually a mix of **Afrobeat, Gospel, RnB, Sungura, and Reggae** — music that keeps me energized, inspired, and grounded.

## What I do
- Architecture and delivery for data-intensive services (batch + streaming)
- Java/Spring microservices with pragmatic DevOps on AWS
- Event-driven design with Kafka (streams, schema, state stores)
- System hardening: observability, reliability, and cost-aware scaling
- Mentoring and building high-performing engineering teams

## Current focus
- Stream processing patterns with Kafka Streams and RocksDB performance tuning
- Event-sourcing and transactional outbox for consistency
- Cloud cost guardrails (right-sizing, autoscaling, data layout)
- Developer experience: golden paths, templates, and code quality tooling

## Highlights
- Database tooling: Delivered cross-platform admin utilities used by DBAs worldwide (Embarcadero/Idera).
- Media metadata distribution: Built large-scale playlist and EPG pipelines (TiVo Corp.).
- Hybrid AWS: Led migrations and built fault-tolerant services across on‑prem and AWS (S3, EC2, DynamoDB, ElastiCache).
- Payments and subscriptions: Integrated Braintree, Stripe, Recurly, BillDesk (UPI), and in‑app purchase workflows.
- Batch and data pipelines: Spring Batch, AWS Batch, AWS DMS for resilient movement and transformation.

## Speaking & writing
- I share practical notes on architecture, Java/Spring practices, and platform thinking.
- Popular topics: testing strategies, migration playbooks, and production debugging.

## Tech stack (abridged)
- **Core Java & Algorithms**: Extensive experience with Java concurrency, memory management, and data IO.  
- **Distributed Systems**: 7+ years of experience designing, building, and operating high-scale distributed systems. 
- **Performance Optimization**: Expertise in identifying and eliminating bottlenecks, improving data flow, and
optimizing performance. 
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Highly proficient in AWS (ECS, Lambda, MKS, S3, RDS, Batch, SQS, SNS), Docker, Kubernetes,
and CI/CD practices (Terraform) to ensure operational excellence (Splunk, Newrelic, Cortex). 
- **Architectural Expertise**: Microservices, Event-Driven Systems, Scalable Distributed Systems, API Design, Platform Engineering.
- **Other Proficiencies**: Graph DB (Neo4j, Dgraph), AI (Cursor AI, Gemini, ChatGPT).

## How I work
- Bias for clarity: simple designs, small PRs, and production-first thinking
- Pragmatic quality: tests that matter, guardrails over gatekeeping
- Operational empathy: logs/metrics/traces by default; SLOs guide design
- Collaborative leadership: unblock fast, mentor often, write it down

## Mentorship
I enjoy coaching engineers on system design, testing, and platform fundamentals. If you’re looking to level up a team or bootstrap a new service safely, I’m happy to help.

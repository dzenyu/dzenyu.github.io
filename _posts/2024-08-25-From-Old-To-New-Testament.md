## A Playful Mnemonic Story

The text below is a light‑hearted way to remember book names in order. After the story, you’ll find a corrected list of the books and minor spelling fixes.

- In the beginning, there was a man called “Genesis.” He started a great journey named “Exodus,” and he arrived at the village named “Leviticus,” where he found people who knew “Numbers” and “Deuteronomy.”
- At the same village, Joshua was amongst the Judges.
- Ruth was his wife who later had sons, 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel.
- They later became kings, 1 Kings and 2 Kings.
- Together, they wrote 2 books, 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles.
- They gave the books to pastor Ezra.
- Nehemiah was an elder and Esther was his wife.
- Job was a deacon who knew Psalms and listed Proverbs and read the book of Ecclesiastes and he also sang the Song of Solomon.
- Isaiah and Jeremiah were great prophets.
- But behold, there were great Lamentations within the land when prophet Ezekiel died.
- Daniel was the governor and Hosea was the administrator who had brothers that were also prophets: Joel, Amos, Obadiah, and Jonah.
- But remember, Micah and Nahum were ushers in the church of Habakkuk.
- Zephaniah helped Haggai, and Zechariah was a weeping prophet; Malachi closed the Old Testament.
- In the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John told the gospel story.
- When these gospels were read, they discovered the Acts of the Apostles.
- The good news spread to the Romans, then to 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians.
- The church decided the message should be taken to the Galatians, Ephesians, and Philippians, and later to the Thessalonians (1 and 2).
- They chose two great men, 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy, who went to share the message with Titus and Philemon, who knew how to speak the Hebrews’ language.
- James had two brothers who were twins, 1 Peter and 2 Peter.
- Together, they wrote three general letters—1 John, 2 John, and 3 John—and gave them to Jude.
- When Jude read them, he saw the Revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen.
